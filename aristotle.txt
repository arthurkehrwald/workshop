After this, the names being once given, it remains to fill in the episodes.
 We must see that they are relevant to the action. In the case of Orestes,
 for example, there is the madness which led to his capture,
 and his deliverance by means of the purificatory rite. In the drama, the episodes are short,
 but it is these that give extension to Epic poetry.
 Thus the story of the Odyssey can be stated briefly.
 A certain man is absent from home for many years; he is jealously watched by Poseidon,
 and left desolate. Meanwhile his home is in a wretched plightâ€”suitors are wasting his substance
 and plotting against his son. At length, tempest-tost, he himself arrives;
 he makes certain persons acquainted with him; he attacks the suitors with his own hand,
 and is himself preserved while he destroys them. This is the essence of the plot;
 the rest is episode.
